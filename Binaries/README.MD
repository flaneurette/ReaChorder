ReaChorder.exe is a Windows binary installer. Setup software provided by innosetup.

The installer is not signed, so Windows might label it as untrusted. A cert is about $400, which I cannot afford. I added the .iss installer template, so perhaps it is possible to compile it if you do not trust it.
